# Tasks: Build and Lint Optimization

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-build-lint-opt/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: No test tasks included - feature focuses on configuration optimization rather than new functionality.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

This feature modifies existing configuration files rather than adding new source code. All changes are to existing Nx monorepo infrastructure.

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Nx Cloud setup and environment preparation

- [ ] T001 Setup Nx Cloud connection for remote caching (optional but recommended)
- [ ] T002 Verify current Nx workspace configuration baseline

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core configuration changes that enable all optimization features

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [ ] T003 Update nx.json parallel execution limit from 2 to 6
- [ ] T004 Configure Nx namedInputs for precise cache invalidation in nx.json
- [ ] T005 Add maxCacheSize configuration to prevent cache bloat in nx.json
- [ ] T006 Update targetDefaults for build, lint, and typecheck caching in nx.json

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all optimization infrastructure configured

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Fast Local Development (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable developers to run build and lint processes quickly during local development

**Independent Test**: Run `pnpm all` locally and verify completion in under 2 minutes

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T007 [US1] Disable expensive ESLint type-checked rules in packages/eslint/src/configs/source.ts
- [ ] T008 [US1] Disable projectService in ESLint parser options for faster linting
- [ ] T009 [US1] Test local performance improvements with time pnpm all

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should deliver 40-60% faster local builds

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Efficient CI Pipeline (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Optimize CI to provide fast feedback on pull requests and releases

**Independent Test**: Push a small change and verify CI completes affected tasks in under 5 minutes

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T010 [US2] Update CI workflow to use fetch-depth: 0 for affected detection
- [ ] T011 [US2] Enable pnpm caching in GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] T012 [US2] Replace full builds with nx affected command in CI
- [ ] T013 [US2] Add Nx Cloud integration for remote caching in CI
- [ ] T014 [US2] Test CI performance improvements on a sample PR

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 2 should deliver 50-70% faster CI execution

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Scalable Build System (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Ensure the build system scales efficiently as the monorepo grows

**Independent Test**: Add a test project and verify build times don't increase linearly

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T015 [US3] Verify parallel execution works across multiple projects
- [ ] T016 [US3] Test cache invalidation with complex dependency chains
- [ ] T017 [US3] Validate affected execution handles new project additions
- [ ] T018 [US3] Monitor memory usage during parallel builds

**Checkpoint**: At this point, all user stories should work together for scalable performance

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Validation, monitoring, and documentation improvements

- [ ] T019 [P] Run quickstart.md validation steps
- [ ] T020 Create performance monitoring script for ongoing measurement
- [ ] T021 Update AGENTS.md with new build performance capabilities
- [ ] T022 Document rollback procedures in case of issues

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of other stories

### Within Each User Story

- Configuration changes can be applied in any order within a story
- Testing should follow implementation
- Each story should be independently testable

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Stories

```bash
# Launch all user stories in parallel after foundational phase:
Task: "Disable expensive ESLint type-checked rules in packages/eslint/src/configs/source.ts"
Task: "Update CI workflow to use fetch-depth: 0 for affected detection"
Task: "Verify parallel execution works across multiple projects"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test local performance improvements
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test local performance → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test CI performance → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test scalability → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds performance improvements without breaking previous optimizations

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (local development)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (CI pipeline)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (scalability)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Configuration changes are reversible for easy rollback
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: cross-story dependencies that break independence</content>
